# OurSOL – Community-Powered Value on Solana

**Status: Archived Prototype / In Exploration**

OurSOL was an experimental project exploring how communities could co-own, govern, and grow assets on the Solana blockchain. The goal was to design a system where:

- ✳️ Every wallet receives equal voting power
- 💰 Value accrual is community-driven (not VC-controlled)
- 🧠 Token mechanics encourage collaboration over speculation

## 🔧 What Was Built

- [x] Tokenomics whitepaper (in `notes/`)
- [x] Solana smart contract scaffold using Anchor
- [ ] Frontend prototype (WIP)
- [ ] Community governance demo (not started)

## 🔍 Lessons Learned

This project was paused as I shifted focus to AI/AGI research. However, OurSOL taught me:

- How to structure Solana programs with Anchor
- Key principles of DAO incentive design
- Pitfalls of token-first thinking vs product-first building

## 💬 Status

Paused indefinitely. May reuse core ideas for future DAO experiments.
